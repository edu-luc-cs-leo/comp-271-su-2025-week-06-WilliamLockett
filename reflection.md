# COMP 271 WEEK 5 REVIEW

For the assignemnt for week 5, all of my tests passed and I feel pretty happy with how my work turned out. One thing I noticed was different was the way we did the remove(String string) method. I realize now that I could've just used the remove method previously made for int index. Another difference was with stringTo, I did not use stringbuilder and probably should have. I did however use StringBuilder for this assignment tho. Our method for indexOf were also different, yours was more practical and better written. I am not too familiar with ternanry operator but now I see how it can be useful and will deffinetly practice it. Besides those differences, our method for remove(int index) was practically the same as well as countOf. Overall, I think I did well, all my code passed the tests, but I see how I still have many areas to improve on.
